# Context and motivation

## What is bias?

A __systematic error__, or deviation from the truth, in results

--

Bias is &lt;u&gt;__not__&lt;/u&gt; the same as:

.tricolumn[
.tricolhead[
### Reporting
]
.small[
Good methods may have been used but not well reported 
]
]

???

The RoB2 tool (and RoB1 tool before it) both seek to measure bias. 
Other tools assessing trials for systematic reviews frequently assess issues related to imprecision, quality and reporting. 

The team that  developed the RoB2 tool are seeking to assess only bias or “Systematic error”

 Imprecision refers to random error. Each time trialists take a sample and measure outcomes, they will get natural variation from the ‘true’ values in the whole population. 
The smaller the sample, the more variability. Imprecision is reflected in the confidence interval around the treatment effect. 

Bias is not the same as quality in study conduct:  The RoB team moved substantially away from methods found in other tools – which often assess – methodological quality” of the trial – or “did the trialists do the best they can do..?” 
Whereas… Bias focuses on “Do I believe the result?”
The terms “Quality” and “bias” are often used interchangeably, but we are more interested in the believability of the result than criticising the efforts made by study authors. 
Even a well conducted study can be at risk of bias, for example, in studies where it’s difficult to blind participants and trial personnel - such as  surgical trials – the study may be conducted very well – have “high quality” - but we still acknowledge the possibility that the lack of blinding might affect the study results. 

Also not all markers of “poor conduct” in trials are relevant to bias. For example, failure to perform a sample size calculation, or to obtain ethical approval, are important markers of study quality, but they are unlikely to have direct implications for risk of  bias.

And 
Bias is not the same as the quality of reporting
Studies rarely have space to report the methods used in exhaustive detail and may often have used rigorous methods even if they are not described in the published paper. 

Reporting is improving with initiatives like the CONSORT statement. It is important not to discriminate against older trials that were published before these initiatives, and for us to be clear- in our  assessments of bias - in these trials – whether our decisions are based on methods reported in the paper, and when the details are not reported in the trial.. .some tools to assess trials for RCTs have confused these issues

Bias also not the same as concerns re generalisability

Indirectness = just because you are not studying the population of interest, doesn't mean the answer is biased.

## Problems with existing tool (RoB 1)

Used simplistically &amp; inconsistently

Modest agreement rates between assessors

No __overall__ risk-of-bias judgement

???

__1__ Guidance not followed, and domains added or removed

&lt;hr&gt;

__2__ This was partly influence by the overuse of the unclear judgement, which was itself ambiguous.

Can provide references for this if you want
&lt;hr&gt;

__3__ Problematic if you want to carry result of forward, which we will explore tomorrow afternoon (__SIGNPOST__)

# RoB2 Key Features

---

## RoB2 is a result-focused tool

It assesses a __single outcome__ at a __single timepoint__

&lt;br&gt;

???
Essentially assessing a single numerical result chosen


More specific than study/outcome based

## Bias in randomised trials

![](../images/domains_overview_no_rob.png)

???

Bias introduced through conduct/dissemination of results

These aspects are based on empirical research and theory

May be familiar, but worth checking how they are defined within the RoB 2 tool

__Note:__ Only for RCTs - for non-randomised studies, check ROBINS-I

__Note:__ for the purposes of this course, we will be focusing on standard RCTS (rather than cluster or other RCTs).

There are additional issues in cross-over trials and cluster-randomized trials, and different versions of RoB 2 have been developed for these designs.


---

## Bias in randomised trials

![](../images/domains_overview.png)

???

Domains map onto the elements or domains of bias

---

## Domains

All domains are __mandatory__

Additional domains (e.g. "other biases") should not be added

Issues around __funding/COIs __are handled elsewhere

__Reporting biases__ handled elsewhere e.g. ROB-ME

---

## Comparison with RoB 1 Domains

__Hold for table__

---

## The effect of interest



---

## Signalling questions

Reasonably factual __signalling questions__ aim to facilitate judgements and increase transparency

__Example:__ Was the allocation sequence random?

???

Authors encouraged to record rationale and direct quotes

--

Possible responses: .g[‘__Yes__’], .g[‘__Probably yes__’], .r[‘__Probably no__’], .r[‘__No__’], ‘__No information__’

---

## Domain-level judgements

Possible judgements:
* .g[‘Low risk of bias’]
* ‘Some concerns’
* .r[‘High risk of bias’]

???

--

__Algorithms__ provided suggested domain-level judgements

???

Based on responses to signalling questions. We'll introduce these in greater detail later.

--

.box[Suggested risk-of-bias judgements can be over-ridden
]

---

## Overall risk of bias

.left-column[.g[__Low risk of bias__]]
The study is judged to be at __low risk of bias__ for all domains _for this result_.

???

Overall risk of bias judgement follows from the domain-level judgements (can be over-ridden)

--

.left-column[__Some concerns__&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;]

The study is judged to be at __some concerns__ in at least one domain _for this result_, and no domains are at high risk of bias


--
.left-column[.r[__High risk of bias__&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;]]

`#`1 - The study is judged to be at __high risk of bias__ in at least one domain _for this result_.&lt;br&gt;
--
`#`2 - The study is judged to have __some concerns__ for multiple domains in a way that substantially lowers confidence _in this result_.

???

__SIGNPOST:__ When I say there are two ways to get there, I talking about the algorithms that we use to go from domain level judgements to overall judgements.p

## Preliminary considerations

# Domain 1: Bias arising from the randomisation process

# Why is randomization important?

Bias introduced when **factors that influence the outcome** predict:

Factors could be severity of illness or presence of comorbidites

Knowledge of the next assignment could lead to people being excluded on the basis of factors

Trial assessing effect of pre-dive checklist on scuba diving accidents

Sometimes methods described are good, but results show that there was a problem

Purpose of the extra question is the assess this.

* __Excess__ of statistically significant baseline differences

If 20 variables were measured at baseline, would you expect at least one variable to have an imbalance resulting in a P-value &lt; 0.05?
