## Welcome to the course! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29px">

I am very much looking forward to meeting you all in early July!

__Note that while there are no formal prerequisites for this course__, I would encourage you to familiarise yourself with the example RCT we will be using throughout (see the [Course Resources](#demo) section). There will be (limited) time to read the paper on the day, but doing so in advance will allow you to jump straight into applying the RoB2 tool.
