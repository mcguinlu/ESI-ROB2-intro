# Domain 3: <br>Bias due to missing outcome data

class: center, middle

## Missing outcome data

Several causes of missing outcome data:

* Participant __withdrew__, cannot be __found__ or __died__

* Participant __did not attend__ study visit at which outcome was measured

* Data __lost__ or __unavailable__

???

Touched on this issues yesterday

Exclusions from analysis for reasons other than missing data should be dealt with in domain two.

E.g. if patient has outcome data but did not attend all sessions and so was excluded from the analyses

---

## When is missing data an issue?



Example: 

---

## Four scenarios

.left-column[**No bias**]


.right-column[Missingness unrelated to true values]

???

E.g. data missing because automatic measuring device failed for subset of participants

<hr>

--

.left-column[<br>**Bias**]

.right-column[<br>Missingness depends on true values and on intervention group]

<br>


???

Those with continuing symptoms more likely to drop out (reflects the true value, e.g. more depression) __AND__

more drop-outs in experimental group due to side effects 

<hr>

--

.left-column[<br><br>**No bias**__*__]

.right-column[<br>Missingness depends on true values but things are identical in both groups]

.footer[__*__ Slightly more complicated - see RoB 2 guidance]


???

Those with continuing symptoms more likely to drop out (reflects the true value, e.g. more depression) __AND__

the experimental intervention has no effect

<hr>

--

.left-column[<br><br>**Likely bias**__*__]

.right-column[<br>Missingness depends on true values and effects of intervention and comparator differ]

???

Those with continuing symptoms more likely to drop out __AND__

the experimental intervention has an effect

<hr>

Not an easy area to consider

__*__ More complicated than this - see RoB2 guidance!

---

## What proportion of missingness is an issue?

No hard and fast rule for allowable proportion of missing outcome data

???

If missing outcome data is causing bias, strength of bias will increase as amount of missing outcome data increases

## Signalling questions

.left-column[
Any missing data?
<br>

Robust results?
<br>

Missingness depends on result?

]

.right-column[
**3.1** Were data for this outcome available for all, or nearly all, participants randomized?

**3.2** If .r[N/PN]/NI to 3.1: Is there evidence that the result was not biased by missing outcome data?

**3.3** If .r[N/PN] to 3.2: Could missingness in the outcome depend on its true value?  
**3.4** If .r[Y/PY]/NI to 3.3: Is it likely that missingness in the outcome depended on its true value?

# Suggested reponses for Domain 3

---

## Q 3.1 Were data for this outcome available for all, or nearly all, participants randomized?

--

**Response:** .r[__No__]

--

**Judgement:** At 4 months, missing data for 7 patients in the aerobic group (5 lost to follow-up, 2 refused to participate) and 13 patients in the relaxation group (9 lost to follow-up, 4 refused to participate). This is quite a large proportion of both groups, and higher in the relaxation group.

???

Note: imputed data should be regarded as missing data, and not considered as ‘outcome data’ in the context of this question.

---

## Q 3.2 If .r[N/PN]/NI to 3.1: Is there evidence that the result was not biased by missing outcome data?

--

**Response:** .r[__No__]

--

**Judgement:** No sensitivity analyses are presented, but were planned according to the protocol. 

???

Note that imputing the outcome variable, either through methods such as ‘last-observation-carried-forward’ or via multiple imputation based only on intervention group, should not be assumed to correct for bias due to missing outcome data.

---

## Q 3.3 If .r[N/PN] to 3.2: Could missingness in the outcome depend on its true value?

--

**Response:** .r[__Yes__]

--

**Judgement:**

---

## Q 3.4 If .r[Y/PY]/NI to 3.3: Is it likely that missingness in the outcome depended on its true value?

--

**Response:** .r[__Probably Yes__]

--

**Judgement:** More people were missing in the relaxation group. It is plausible – and indeed we regard it as quite likely – that people allocated to this group were missing because their depression remained the same or got worse.

But you may disagree and judge this to be .g[__Probably No__]

# Suggested reponses for Domain 4

---

## Q 4.1 Was the method of measuring the outcome inappropriate?

--

**Response:** .g[__No__]

--

**Judgement:** Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a widely used instrument for measuring the degree of depression.

---

## Q 4.2 Could measurement or ascertainment of the outcome have differed between intervention groups?

--

**Response:** .g[__No__]

--

**Judgement:** There is no indication that measurement of the outcome differed between intervention groups.

---

## Q 4.3 If .g[N/PN]/NI to 4.1 and 4.2: Were outcome assessors aware of the intervention received by study participants?

--

**Response:** .r[__Yes__]

--

**Judgement:** “The patient administered Becks Depression Inventory scale, which consists of 21 items that each can be scored from 0 to 3, is also included.”. (Protocol/design paper)
Patients were aware of their intervention allocation.

---

## Q 4.4 If /r[Y/PY]/NI to 4.3: Could assessment of the outcome have been influenced by knowledge of intervention received?

--

**Response:** .r[__Yes__]

--

**Judgement:** Knowledge of the assigned intervention could influence participant-reported outcomes such as depressive symptoms.

---
## Q 4.5 If .r[Y/PY]/NI to 4.4: Is it likely that assessment of the outcome was influenced by knowledge of intervention received?

--

**Response:** .g[__Probably No__]

--

**Judgement:** I think that it is unlikely that patients would complete the Beck Depression Inventory differently according to their assigned intervention.

But you may disagree and judge this to be .r[__Probably Yes__]

## Signalling questions

**5.1** Were the data that produced this result analysed in accordance with a pre-specified analysis plan that was finalized before unblinded outcome data were available for analysis?

<br>
Is the numerical result being assessed likely to have been selected, on the basis of the results, from ...

**5.2** ... multiple eligible outcome measurements (e.g. scales, definitions, time points) within the outcome domain?

**5.3** ... multiple eligible analyses of the data?

# Suggested reponses for Domain 5

---

## Q 5.1 Were the data that produced this result analysed in accordance with a pre-specified analysis plan that was finalized before unblinded outcome data were available for analysis?

--

**Response:** .g[__Probably Yes__]

--

**Judgement:** The protocol (design paper) appears to provide a pre-specified analysis plan. 

But concerns over timing of protocol submission

???

Protocol paper submitted for publication in August 2005 and accepted in July 2006, whereas recruitment to the trial took place from January 2005 to July 2006. 

It is possible that the document was edited to react to seeing results. 

However, here we presume that such edits were not made.

---

## Q 5.2 Is the numerical result being assessed likely to have been selected, on the basis of the results, from multiple eligible outcome measurements (e.g. scales, definitions, time points) within the outcome domain?

--

**Response:** .g[__No__]

--

**Judgement:** These were pre-specified in the design paper and presented in the paper.

---

## Q 5.3 Is the numerical result being assessed likely to have been selected, on the basis of the results, from multiple eligible analyses of the data?
 
--
 
**Response:** .g[__Probably No__]

--

**Judgement:** There is indication of multiple analyses of the data, and the analysis method used for this outcome in the full trial report matches that in the design paper.

# Overall RoB and <br> Integration into Synthesis

## Incorporating bias assessments in analyses


“ It is not appropriate to present analyses and interpretations while ignoring flaws identified during the assessment of risk of
bias”

???

__Cochrane Handbook, Chapter 7__

--

Suggested approaches:

1) Primary analysis restricted to studies at low risk of bias (or low + some concerns)

2) Present multiple (stratified) analyses / Explore the impact of RoB

3) Present all studies and provide a narrative discussion
